                    <p id ="f4">In 2013, the house was renamed the Graham Historical House in honor of the original builder and owner, William Graham. Also, in the late summer of 2013, fresh renovations to the exterior and the interior of the house began. First, the replacement of damaged wood siding, priming, and painting brought about a sharp, clean look to the historic exterior. Also, the scraping, sanding, priming, and painting of the picket fence accentuates the entrance to the Graham Historical House grounds. Interior renovations, with repairs to plaster walls and wainscoting, painting and wallpapering, and new flooring were completed in November, 2014. These restorations would not have been possible without the generous donations of the Van Drunen Family.</p>
